Based on a dream that i had... i present:
=================================
GruuVe'z    <DreamLANd>   v1.1        
=================================
for Action Quake   <action.telefragged.com>

a deep sleep can come take you to strange places...
This dream was actually about a map that I had made earlier,
named Chasm. My dream was better... so i built it!

Thanx to everyone who gave critique of Chasm, especially the folx at
AQMD <mapdepot.net>.  A (much better) rebuild of Chasm will soon be available for you Small-map-liking-LPB's.
====================================

name: dream.bsp   v 1.1    --  still to be tested by AQMD
author: GruuVe  ('groove')
mod: action    DM and Teamplay
reason: built for an upcoming LANfest up here in the frozen north.

time to build: 30-40 hours, after redoing lighting the third time.
date finished:   jan 30 99 /

brushes: 600!    remember- brushes dont exist after QBSP
	so...   pay attention to those R_SPEEDS kiddies!  

timing:     (p2 416 ; 64 mb pc100 )
-qbsp3: 11 secs
-qvis3: 2383 secs
-arghrad: 426 secs

note...  i tested it on my p133, 4mb S3-virge, 32mb EDO... so DONT bitch bout me being a MHertzHog... i know how it feels to be deprived, and sympathize... so i build my maps capable of running on ol'bessie ( overclocked p120 to p133).

to try it out in single player, at the console type:

set game action;map dream

The basic gameflow is circular,  like ARMYTERR,  but has sidetracks to make teamplay more interesting. It is already in the process of being turned into H-L format,  and so will soon become a TF2 map.
