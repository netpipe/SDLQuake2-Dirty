* Author's Notes *

There's an MP5 on the second level of the cement building, a sniper rifle on
top of the brick building, a shotgun under some stairs somewhere, some
grenades in a dark ally, and a hand cannon in the rubble.  If you try real
hard you can jump from the roof of the brick building to the third floor of
the cement building (makes for a cool get-away).
