Description             : Map for Action Quake (http://aq2.action-web.net).
			
			  The map is set on the rooftops of eight highrise buildings.
			  It's a long way to the ground, so don't fall off :)

Installation            : Unzip rooftops.zip into the root of your Action Quake
                          game folder (Quake2/action), with Subdirectories
                          enabled (!)

Changed since b1.25	: A trigger_hurt was added to the ground level. If you
			  touch the ground a 3 second timer will be started that
			  activates the trigger_hurt for 0.01 seconds and kills every
			  one still alive on the ground. This only really applies to TP
			  games, since you are able to get to the ground before "action"
			  and survive the fall that way. However, the trigger_hurt will
			  always be triggered 3 seconds after someone has touched the
			  ground, so if you manage to fall EXACTLY three seconds after
			  someone else, you will be killed by this entity. This only means
			  that if someone shot you off the roof, he/she won't get a kill
			  for your flight. 

			  Other than that, the map is exactly the same as in 1.25.
