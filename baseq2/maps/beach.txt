Description             : Map for Action Quake (http://aq2.action-web.net).
			
			  The map is an old and abandoned beach resort that doesn't
			  really appeal to tourists anymore, and has therefore been over-
			  taken by light industry. Feel free to take a dip in the water, 
			  but don't forget to be on the lookout for bad guys.

Installation            : Unzip beach.zip into the root of your Action Quake
                          game folder (Quake2/action), with subdirectories
                          enabled (!)
