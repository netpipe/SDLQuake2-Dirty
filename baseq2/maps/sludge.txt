Description           : Based off a deathmatch level i made, i made some changes, added some 
			things, and made it as good and as realistic as i could for the 
			Action Quake mod. Its set in a water-treatment facility..and has lotsa 
			lvl-over0lvl fighting and things.
Thanks To 	      : Bwarff - Got me addicted to Action Quake, and gave me admin 
			on the local Action Quake server :)
