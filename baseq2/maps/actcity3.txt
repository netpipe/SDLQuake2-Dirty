Description             : Map for Action Quake (http://action.telefragged.com).
                          Action City 3 is sequel to my popular Actcity/Actcity2
                          maps. So many have requested me to do it - here you
                          have it now.
                          Theme of this map is quite similar to 
                          Ritual Entertainment's SiN City maps. Hopefully
                          this is something bit more original as an AQ map.

                          Again I've tried to keep R_SPEEDS low as possible. In most
                          areas on the sides those are no more than 600. AFAIK,
                          World polycount never goes over 1000.

Installation            : * Unzip ACTCITY3.ZIP into root of your Action Quake
                          game folder (Quake2\Action), with Subdirectory Extraction
                          enabled (!), so that all textures and sky will be unzipped
                          into correct directories (USE FOLDER NAMES checkbox
                          in WinZip or -d switch in DOS' PKUnZip).

Miscellaneous Info      : You should have 16-bit textures enabled instead of 8-bit
                          if possible. That'll make sky and certain textures look obviously
                          better.
