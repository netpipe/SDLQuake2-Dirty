Bugs
====

The r_speeds are high in some places mostly due to the vert ramp, but it was so wicked I had to keep it in!

Legal stuff
===========

I dont mind if you decide you want to use this map as a base (not that I recommend it).
I don't mind what you do with the map, if you can con someone into buying it from you then good-luck! Just remember if there is anything legal to do with the map, I NEVER EXISTED :) 
If you want to use the  textures, please first ask the creators of them!If you ask nicely they will surely give them to you, free, yes free of charge.
and if you have any problems, even suggestions, email me. If you want the internet sites of the textures then e-mail me as well.

Thank you for Downloading Rumble in the Bronx, I hope you enjoyed playing as much as i enjoyed making it.
