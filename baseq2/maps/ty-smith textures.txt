My name is Ty Smith, as is posted all 
over this document.  I am currently a 
freelance graphic artist.  The majority
of my time however is devoted to 
Textures / Skins / Icons and GUI.  I mainly 
develop for games, but it would not be 
tough to make a change in venue.  I have 
been doing game art for nearly 2 years now,
but have only recently gotten serious about it.


--Info

If you would like to use any textures you 
see, in part, or in whole.  Contact me at 
the address above.

All of the textures included were meant 
for 16 bit/unrestricted palette output.
However I do have copies in Q2 format. 
Though most you could convert yourself 
without much trouble.

All of the textures for the most part 
took around 10-30 minutes, not including 
minor tweaks later on.  However a few of
the more detailed ones took up to 3 hours. 


--Tools

All textures were done with Adobe Photoshop 5.  
Some were a mixture of scanned 
images/objects + hand touch ups.  All were 
done with a Logitech MouseMan  I currently
do not own a tablet, but if you would like to
contribute one to me, I would accept it 
graciously.
