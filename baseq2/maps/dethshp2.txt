Description             : This map was inspired by the 1992 movie, "Under Siege" 
                          which stars Steven Seagal as "Casey Ryback".

                          Terrorists attempt to wrest control of a US warship and 
                          the only people with the ability and guts to stop them 
                          are cook named Casey and a stripper who had been 
                          unknowingly hired to be a distraction to the crew while 
                          the take-over was in progress.

                          In this map you are Casey and all of the other players 
                          are to be considered terrorists! Terminate them all with 
                          extreme predudice!!
