Notes:

This version of Subway is better in many ways. It's much more faster and
I tried to fix everything that I f**ked up in Subway1. Still doesn't work
properly (also looks UGLY) without a 3D accelerator...    ...but you have
one, right?? And you MUST have AQ2 v0.95 or higher. The newest version can
be downloaded from action.telefragged.com.

* Installation *

Just unzip to your X:\Quake2\Action directory (with subdirectories enabled).
The BSP must end up in X:\Quake2\Action\maps folder.
Textures must end up in X:\Quake2\Action\textures\TTI folder.
New sounds MUST end up in X:\Quake2\Action\sound\world folder.

* Copyright / Permissions *

Authors MAY NOT use this level as a base to build additional levels.
All textures, sounds, anything MAY NOT be used for other maps, but these
files can be freely distributed. This level cannot be sold.
