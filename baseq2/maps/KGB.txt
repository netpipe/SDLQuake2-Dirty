Description             : KGB: Small Action Quake map. Good lay out, be careful
			    of the watch towers though. R_speeds are best of
			    the 2 here.
			  KGB2: Put the edge back in. Increased gravity to 1200 
			    (please do not change). Added a second floor to the 
			    complex to provide a training ground for close quarter 
			    combat. Added more sniper points. Moved sniper rifles 
			    to the ground so you don't have to climb to the top 
			    of the tower. Had to sacrifice most of outside due to r_speeds.
			    The lack of a true theme is the only hurting part
			    of this map in my opinion.
Additional Credits	: The A-Team (Wheres Mr. T?)
			  The guy who wrote QERadiant (Figures I can't find his name)
			  Suicide20 (the guy who I stole the snow
			    textures from :) Gonna have to get a 
			    hold of him some time...
			  Stecki (from Deconstruct) for the Snow sky.
			  Slade from Telefragged for the name of the place.
			  Id Software's cast and crew.

Comments                : KGB: Nope, just a good map for pc's like mine.
			  KGB2: Be prepared for slow downs. I'm gonna work on
			  the lighting in the middle of the map and the top floor
			  of the building. Decided on a higher gravity (1200) to stress
			  situation awareness near ledges.
	  		  Side note: watch the ledge it's the point of no return (ie: death).

Legal Crap		: Yes you can make something real out if this if you want 
			  just e-mail ahead of time so I can send you the map and
			  get some credit out of this shit. In other words I want credit
			  for it if you do.
			  Textures are Suicide20's so talk to him about that.
			  The sky is Stecki's from Decontruct so that's his.
