Single Player           : If you wanna check out the level
Cooperative             : Nope
Deathmatch              : 2 - 20 
Teamplay                : YES!!! This is good with any amount of players and is what I intended the map for.
Difficulty Settings     : No
New Sounds              : No
New Graphics            : I made all except water and glass, the sky is the defualt one that comes with skypaint (wich is alowed to be used freely) I did make my own sky's but the FOV skypaint said to use for q2 sky's didnt line up.

* Construction *

Base                    : A blank grid
Editor(s) used          : Worldcraft 1.6
Known Bugs              : Some light bleeds but no big deal, I forgot to put a light above a door even though the entity is there, not to easy to spot though. Also a brush is the wrong size above the ladder cover outside, it fits in the editor but not after compiling.
Build Time              : About 2 weeks in all, the arcutecture in less then a week and the textures in a few days (I know most are crappy, I spent about 5-10 min or less on each)
Compile Time		: Dunno, forgot to right it down. I just left it on overnight so I would say 4-6 hours
Notes:                  : Ummm hope you enjoy this map! Reall I wish I spent more effort on touching it up, il probably make a #2 but a good deal larger.

This is my first ever map to complete, my 2nd attempt at a AQ level.. the other wouldnt compile from some error resualting
from over detailing (not r_speeds problems), it was cooler looking then this one tho. I tried to let the textures do the
detailing in this one.


* Copyright / Permissions *

Ummm dont use this map for anything without my explicit permision

You can use these textures for your action quake level with my permission, dont use them for anything else at all.
