Description             : Get into the house.
Credits			: Action Quake Team (ALA A-Team)
			  Cap'n Sparky for the tree textures.
			  Ogreman for the original stove and fridge textures.
			  Tall Midget for the texture pack he had (yes, a couple are used).
			  Muzman and his crew. These guys have helped out a lot and 
			  have done a lot in the way of textures, map testing, and ideas.
			  If you need to get a hold of anybody I can tell ya where.
			  Rendition for the V2200, how else could I take a new picture of the floor (yes that's my floor)
			  The guy who made the grass texture. The guy has a bunch of good textures like it. Contact me and I'll get you his site address.
			  Spectacle for telling me it ran better when it was illegal and that I fucked up the texture placement :)

Cooperative             : No (No sense in even bothering with)
Deathmatch              : Yes, Ok, it works in both DM and Teamplay
Difficulty Settings     : Yep, choose players that suck more than you do and it's on easy 
			  and vice versa.
New Sounds              : I could have made some but they would require me to eat some beans.

* Construction *

Base                    : New Map From Scratch
Editor(s) used          : QERadient 1.0 build 077, and build 135 in the end.
Known Bugs              : There are only a couple instances where objects will disappear in
			  software. Don't worry though, nothing important disappears just detail
			  stuff.
			  The 2 textures that aren't in folders fix a bug that comes from one of the textures
			  I'm not sure which ones are causing problems but they're all fixed as far as I care.
Construction Time       : I don't know, so step the fuck off.
Compile Time		: 4.5 hours
Comments                : The lights in the hallway are meant to leave those little bulbs 
			  of light. Sorry about the trees and bushes, I'm not good at
			  anything organic. I found out what I did wrong and the sun works!
			  The fridge looks awesome in software, not quite as good in gl though.
			  No I'm not adding a lid to the toilet, but at least I left a turd!
			  And yes it's supposed to be blue in software.

Legal Mojo		: Decompile it and I'll shoot ya. Hack it and I'll shoot ya. 
Hack my pc to get it and I'll shoot ya. Release a hacked version and I'll shoot ya. 
Other than that you can use the textures I don't care, technically they're not mine. 
Just remember to give credit where due. If you want .map version just ask.
