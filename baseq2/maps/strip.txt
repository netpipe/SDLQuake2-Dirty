		  USELESS INFO
==================================================
Deathmatch:	|You betcha' 1-8 (might get crowded)
		|
Teamplay:	|You better beleive it
		|
Single Player:	|Spawn yourself crazy

		|get something goin')
		|	
Brushes:	|paint brushes, hair brushes, oh
		|shyt, nevermind.
		|
R-speeds:	|Tried to keep em' low by placing
		|unneccessary brushes....
		|
Software Mode:	|Use the textures in the "softext
		|zip. Alot of the textures are 
		|transparent and wont work in Gl.
		|Unzipping the tex in the softext
		|zipfile into c:\quake2\action\
		|will fix this. No colored lighting
		|bland and boring. Buy a video card 
		like the rest of the world. 
====================================================
		EVEN MORE USELESS INFO
====================================================
New Textures:	|Yes!!! Most of em were slapped in
		|by me. 1 texture from the "rhcity"

New Other poop:	|Nothing you need to know about
		|
Does the product|More than anything else i have done. 
reflect my	|I did some neat-o textures. I would have
Initial Vision?	|liked to work on the outside area a 
		|bit more but my ass was in a vice to get
		|it done in time for the "picture this"
		|map contest.
		|
Build Time:	|3 or so days of continous worldcraft 
		|racing against time, lots of time in
		|wally and paint shop pro, and some 
		|work induced dreams.
		|
Bugs:		|I guess the r_speeds are a little 
		|high but i have found that if you
		|use a dial up modem the polly count
		|is the least of your troubles...
		|...besides, there not 1,000
		|everywhere like in Action Halflife maps.
		|Your best bet is to play it on a Lan.
		|Some clipping problems.

You may not use this map as a base, if you do you may
find yourself sleeping with the fishes. You may not
distribute this map in any form, electronic or other-
wise, unless this text document is included and the zip 
file remains intact AND permission has either been 
given or implied by me. If you do, you may find 
yourself waking with the donkeys. You may use the 
textures for other Action Quake maps, but if you do
just remember that your map may be labled as "just 
another strip map."

			Tips
=====================================================
This stuffs pretty much for new mappers, and consists
mostly of stuff I had to figure out.

* Use detail brushes every so often, it will
save on your friggin' vis time. Oh yeah. 

*If you compile your map alot to see how it looks,
you can cut qrad3 time by using the -chop XX command,
were chop XX is the number you want to use. I use 128.
The lower the number, the faster the Qrad, but the 
lower the quality. Max patches end at -chop 16, I think.

* You don't need much ram, just enough room on your
HardDrive for the swap file (qrad3)

* Add more detail with textures. Do't try to make
everything out of brushes. (r_speeds)

* forget prefabs, do your own stuff. It will make
your level more unique. 

* Try and build from reality. All your stuff will
look more realistic.

* If you use gigantic sized textures and then scale
them, they will look sharper, even in glide. However,
the engine can only map so much and in software mode
it might slow the game to turtle crawl speed. Use 
wisely.

* If you do colored lighting, make sure you tell the
compile programs were your textures are, or else move
them to someplace were it can find them.

* Also if you do colored lighting, use a -bounce 1 or
-bounce 0 in the qrad command line. Otherwise, sum
stuff will be too colored and you'll get visual colored
artifacts.

======================================================
	Thanks to all the people who have made Action
Maps. More specifically, thanks to those who showed us
that Action meant more than cities and canyons.	I'd 
also like to thank the guys at the AQMD for not 
releasing everymap that comes thier way. This probably
improves the quality of the mod or something.

***begin ass kissing*** WetWired, Scuzzy, Mexican Radio,
for making and breaking quality standards.

A special exclusive thanks go out to some of the starlets
that inspired this map. Specifically Raylene and Jenna...

   -Dedicated to Dinah, though we shall  never speak-
	(damn, I used this quote im my last readme and 
	 	still haven't spoken.)
