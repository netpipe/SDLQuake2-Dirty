How to Complete the Mission:

You can also win by escaping in the getaway truck.  Before you can do this you must
deactivate the security

If you start inside the bank, this is what you do to escape in the truck.


Firsly go to the top floor of the bank and find a door marked 'SECURITY'.
Approach that door until a message 'Explosives set!' appears.  You now
have to wait 5 seconds until the door explodes and you can enter.
On entering you will see a button on the far right, pressing that will
open the front entrance to the bank and disable the lasers on the top floor. Three seconds after that the lasers on the ground floor will switch off.
To get to the truck pass though where the lasers were on the ground floor.
To start the truck, jump in the back and shoot the far side of it (knives and shot don't work, all else does including kick*) .  The truck will then move away.  When reaching the Hideot area, opening the door to the hideout to kill everyone in the other area.

*Don't blame me, that's just the way it is :)
