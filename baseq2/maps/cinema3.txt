Notes
This level is, I think, fairly well balanced between sniping and running-through-corridoors-shooting-people, there is only one proper sniping position, and a 'secret' weapon. I resisted the temptation to put in an assault rifle for the sake of game balance.
Changes: almost exactly the same as cinema1, but with wallgaps removed and the shotgun 
in a new postion. Its also far easier to get to hard-to-reach areas of the map.
