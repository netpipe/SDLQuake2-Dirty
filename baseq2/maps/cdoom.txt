i'm writing this at 2 am, bear with me.

yes it's a small map, action quake2 should be played with less people.
the absolute max on this map is 8, and it'll be crammed. 4 for a nice
game. 1 on 1 is fun. play more than 8 and chocobos will feed on your
corpse.

the weapon placement is tight, because it's a small map. you have a
better idea about what belongs where? tell me. i hope they don't
add any more weapons :)

slow spots: stand in the back of the church, facing the rafter-type
thingie. also, going down the stairs to the bookcases (why? dunno)
r_speeds hit around 800. at least the afflicted areas are pretty small.

this isn't meant to offend anyone. really. i mean, it's a church of
DOOM (the game damnit, the game!) and if there's a church where violence
is a good thing, this is it :) really, it's a game, lighten up. this
map isn't about any personal agendas.

and if this offends you, don't buy xenogears ;)

and my spelling probably offends you too.

erm extra special props to cail for giving me the slapping around
that i needed. :) erm, i would also list testers here... but i've
honlestly FORGOT who got what. and the rest of the aq2 team, and
you know why. oh yeah, hola to elehyyam von houten, just cause (don't ask)

and if you care to know, the bottom floor was redone no less than 6 times.

string a few alphanumberic characters for me at stevet3@ix.netcom.com
stupid mail will be handed to Aerith for post-mortem-processing (say hello
to /dev/null)
