Description             : Map originally made for Action Quake (http://action.telefragged.com).
                          The lava tube was inspired by a canyoning weekend I had in the Blue Mountains
			  , Sydney, Australia. Particulary features that inspired me were the lighting effects of 
			  natural sunlight bouncing down in to canyon.

Installation            : Unzip labatube.zip into root of your Action Quake
                          game folder (like c:\games\Quake2\Action), with Subdirectory Extraction
                          enabled , so that all textures, sounds and sky will be unzipped
                          into correct directories.

Additional information  : This map relies on certain features of quake version 3.20 and hardware 3d accelleration. If either
			  the accelleration or the game version differ transparency in certain location will appear a flesh
			  pink colour.
 
Additional Credits to   : David Hyde, resident guru at the RUST quake editing forum. Without his advise, explainations
			  and wonderful Gensurf application this map would never have been created.
                          Robert Duffy for QERadiant
			  Tim Wright for Arghrad
                          All the guys who helped me out at RUST
			  The BIOF clan(if you call them that) for playtesting.
			  All the people who have told me how cool the map is(trust me it make a difference)
			  And most importantly my poor wife Jasmin who will get her husband back for a while
			  (until I start my next map ;-) )

Editor(s) Used            : QERadiant build 147 
			    Gensurf 1.3 (at the time)
                            Adobe Photoshop texturing and bitmaps for Gensurf
                            Terragen for Sky
			    Additionally Pviewer a portal viewer by DiD was used to troubleshoot r_speeds.

Known Bugs                : Currently a tree has a small sliver of light that can be seen through it.

Due to the nature of this map's construction only heafty machines of the 300mhz class or 3D accellerated machines 
are likely to run this map well. If an average of the map were take it would likely reveal an r_speed average of 
about 400 however 3 area's in particular have higher averages of about 700 and a map peak of about 1200. So in 
short this map is not well suited to software mode. That said, I have to admit that level is particularly ugly in 
software mode and running it at 640x480 still yielded a playable speed, not that I can see how anyone can play in 
that pixilation blizzard :-). 

The map was originally designed with a conversion to TFC in mind hence the CTF'ish confrontation style of the map. 
However a twist in fate saw HL's compiling utilities choke hard on my map, so no TFC version.

Additionally 2 flag spawn points have been added for anyone who wants to use it with CTB.


The map seems to be pushing the limits of BSP which seems to crash whenever I add a single extra brush. So I had 
lots of fun adding one here, deleting one there ...
