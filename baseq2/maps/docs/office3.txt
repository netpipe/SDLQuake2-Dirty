Notes:

This is a slight change from office.bsp. Office.bsp assumed some things in our action dll that can't be, and
had to be changed. Also, office.bsp was DAMN slow in lotsa places, something this corrects. The lighting also looks
about 100 times better in this version, but no cool emergency lights anymore.

Office3 simply fixes those microfissure sparklies, and puts the shotgun back in the bar.

This is my first map ever. I have done duke3d maps, doom maps, but never quake/q2 maps...
I realize it shows, but i think that the level layout works VERY well, and design isn't too bad

And one more thing, the sky looks SO much better in 16bit if you can afford it (ie, voodoo2, high powered system)
