ever read these files anyway. Bogglet. If any users feel that they could make a better map, then
they are by all means encouraged to start makin a map and see how well they do. Don't give me
that "I don't know how" excuse either. No map makers started off knowing everything about mapping.
If you're still reading this far, congratulations. I am extremly bored and tired of mapping, so 
I just keep typing and typing and typing. Hi mom. Late at night all systems go, you have come to
see the show. We do our best, you're the rest, you make it real you know. There is a feeling deep
inside that drives you f&#*@n' mad. A feeling of a hammerhead, you need it oh so bad. Adrenaline
starts to flow, you're thrashing all around, acting like a maniac, whiplash! I think I'm gonna
keep typing just to see how dedicated some of you people are. Its the zZ's! If you recieved this
map in any way without this readme file, then you aren't reading this, are you? This product is
not supported by Microsoft or Apple, and thats good because they both suck. You may not rent, 
lease, or sell this product without my permission, no matter what Suislide says. you may not use
map for matches once it becomes boring and unpopular, which seems to be the craze on the OGL 
nowadays. You are required by law to brag to your friends with this map to try and get them hooked
ok Action Quake 2. You man not say the words "I Win!" while playing teamplay on this map, unless
it is 1 on 1. There are no single winners in a teamplay game. You may not bitch about LPB's while
playing this map. If your name is akaine, or any variation, you are required to type kill at the
beginning of every round on this map. Thanks for scaring me early one morning during the summer
FiReWaLKeR[TDm] when I was reading map text files for fun and found a mention of "pacman" in one.
