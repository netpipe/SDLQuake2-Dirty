Authors may NOT use this level as a base to build additional
levels.

All new graphics that comes with this map (in TEXTURES/ALCATRAZ and ENV/ALCATRAZ) were created by me and therefore are my legal property. However, authors may use those textures in their ACTION QUAKE maps if they give me credit.
