 Known Bugs              : Call it a bug if yah a wanka, the elevator might be a shit to get up.. All you have to do is climb most of the way up and then strafe to the side, you will happily land on a lil ledge, if not, you will fall and lose health.. But think about it for a min, if it was the middle of the night and there was a fu*cked elevator in a dark city, would you be climbing around in it?
                  
* Other Info *

If anyone cares, i added some jumps like in urban1, go find em, jump em and send me your demo's i would love to see them.. :)

I included a demo on how to use the elevator, i dont see why so many people had trouble with it! :) its easy really..

* Distribution *

You aren't allowed to distribute this map on a CD or sell it, unless i recieve money or a blow job.
Dont think your gonna be using this for a base of one of your levels.
You better not complain about this map..
You may give me money for no reason.
You had also better tell me how damn good it is.. or else i might not be bothered makin another one..
If YOU wanna use THESE textures i didn't make em so haha go somewhere else and find out, but if you love my TDm, TDm clan members, joes tavern or Petes crash repair --they ROCK ;)-- go ahead and use em, hhaaha like anyone will.
