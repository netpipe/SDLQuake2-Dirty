Description             : An Action Quake map, designed origionally for
                          teamplay, but there are weapons and ammo for DM play
                          if you should wish to try it.

                          This map is a dark, open, mainly outside map,
                          Featuring a fort, and outpost, and a large underground
                          cave system.
                          Some areas are a bit too dark for some people, but I
                          Prefer it like that.
                          If enough people pester me to make a brighter version,
                          I may well oblige, as this is my first 'proper' map
                          and, I'm not that sure about what people will think.
                          So, you want summat changed, tell me :)

Installation            : * Unzip fortcave.zip into root of your Action Quake
                          game folder (Quake2\Action), and make sure you
                          extract the directory structure too.
