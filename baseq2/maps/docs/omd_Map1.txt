Please Note: this map was designed to hopefully eliminate spray N Prayers.
There is plenty of ammo but in order to survive this map you must know how to hide , bandage and keep killing.

I have noticed personally  that when playing the only people who play any good on any map at all are those who know how to stay alive at all costs - They do this for the same reason I do The scoreing rewards you more for getting more kills in a row than die-kill-die-kill - Check out the scoring info on the action web page - you will understand soon enough.
I can get scores up to 100 agains 8 people  when 2 were using z-bot cheats or gl-cheats.. 
I am not saying i am great but i am saying that spray and pray is not the way to go. AMEN!

BTW: Mantidoba is the latin word for Mantis as in Preying Mantis - and the b is silent! :)
