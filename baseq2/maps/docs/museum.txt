Rare paintings, sculted precious stones, works of art that certain collectors would pay 
a fortune for...
Are you the art thief, intent on making your fortune by cashing in on the hungers of the 
rich and corrupt? Or are you the detective, staking out the museum in attempt to track down
the criminal responsible for a string of museum robberies? Or are you a night watchman, just 
doing his job? Or maybe you're just a night worker, interupted while trying to repair a 
broken skylight -- an ordinary person in an extraordinary circumstance......

There are 3 galleries displaying paintings and 1 with some abstract sculpture.
Also, there's a security room, a gift shop, a main hall, and an extensive rooftop area.

All "abstract sculptures" are nameless formations made by me for the map, are in 
no way copyrighted, and if they resemble any existing art, it's purely coincidental.
