* Construction *
Base                    : That big empty grid you get when you start out afresh... :)
Editor(s) used          : QERadiant.
Known Bugs              : A few, but not enough to warrant rebuilding the map. Room 27's 	door goes a little out of alignment when it opens, and a few of the roof light textures are out of alignment. These are the ones I know about :)
	Let me know of any more, and I'll fix them in any later version(s).   
			                            
* Build Time *
Unknown. A few days to make, and about 1 hour to compile fully.

Details:
Mental hospital with private rooms, operating theatre, ward, reception, life, stairs, cells, padded room, interrogation chambers, coke machines, garden and rec. room. I didn't base it on real life experiences, ok? =)
I tried to make this map as atmospheric as I can. Hence the rain on the windows (anyone know how to make the texture cycle faster?), thunder (I put lightning, but it broke in later versions so I took it out :)), (hopefully) moody lighting and leather restraints :). The stereo is playing a very short sample of a little-known song; the artists are called Ouch!!!. The thunder and rain sounds come from a pretty good flight sim. 
Suggestions are more than welcome.
And remember: take your medicine and nurse won't have to strap you in...

PS. I hope you like the little respectful nods I've added :).
Thanks to the guy who made Coventry for the textures I used; only two flat colour ones, but it saved me making new ones, and your harddrive space :).

PPS. I was planning to put in a few touches like Redrum and an axed-down door, but I never really got time. Sorry :)
