-Info and plain stupid crap written down-
Some old dams just get abandoned when they dry out. This wasn't.
This one was made to be a tourist sight for a while. Then the 
maniacs came. Creeping out at night, they run around, trying to
shoot each other, slithing each others throats, yes, even kicking
each other to death...
They Cannot be stopped...
They are Action Quakers...

-Installation-
Just unzip into the action dir

-Legal Stuff-
All textures used in this map are free to use; I've copied
most of them myself since I'm not that good at making textures.
You may reproduce this map if you want to, but please give me cred :-)
You may distribute this map in any way you wan't (yes, that includes
copying it out onto CDs and throwing it at people, but I wouldn't
advice it)
