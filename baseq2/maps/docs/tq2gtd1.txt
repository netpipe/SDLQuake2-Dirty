Description             : The first official "Get That Drug" Level
			  for Terror Quake2. It's a big city map

			  two bases.
Requirements            : Quake2, Terror Quake2, enough HD space ;-)
================================================================
Additional Credits
The Wally Team		: Ty Matthews and  Neal White III for that
			  GREAT texture editor
The Qoole Team		: For making an editor no one can use right
			  because of that DAMN rounding bug. I've
			  just changed because of this bug, so my next 
			  credit goes to:
raduffy@cyberramp.net	: for making QERadiant, an editor which REALLY
			  ROCKS!!!
Jasc Software		: for making that GREAT graphic program
			  Paint Shop Pro v5.0
Rookie[Rock]		: (aka Michael Bastian) for endless
			  playtesting with me ;-)

* Play Information *
Q2 Single Player        : Not intended (only for sightseeing)
Q2 Cooperative          : No
Q2 Deathmatch           : Not intended (ammo? which ammo?)
Q2 CTF                  : Not intended (ammo? which ammo?)
Single Player (TQ2)	: Not intended
Deathmatch (TQ2)        : Yes, should be fine
Get That Drug (TQ2)	: Yes - the map was especially made for
			  this one :)
* Construction *
Base                    : From scratch (own idea)
Editors used            : Qoole V2.50 (If they only used integer
                          for their calculations...) - but they didn't,
			  so I've changed to QERadiant. 
			  Oh boy, this editor REALLY ROCKS!
                          Wally V1.24B for the textures
			  PSP V5.0 as additional editor for textures
Textures		: All textures are made by me, no standard
			  textures are used, so there shouldn't be
			  a problem with copyrights (they're all mine).
			  Starking is copyright 1999 by Stefan Giesen, TJPC
			  (If you want to know more about it, go to my
			   homepage)
Known Bugs              : hm, it looks like the escalators are a dancing
			  around a little in an internet-game (you'll see 
			  what i mean), but it's not so bad that I want 
			  to disable them ;)
