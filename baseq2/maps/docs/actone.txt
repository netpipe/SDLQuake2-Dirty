* How to use this level *

Get Action Quake2 from here: http://action.telefragged.com/ and connect to a server running this map.  To just see the map (single player like but empty), type "game action" then "map actone" in the Quake2 console.

* Credits *

Of course to ID Software for Quake 2, then to the A-Team for Action Quake 2.
I used 2 prefabs that I found at The Quake Prefab Park 2 (http://www.planetquake.com/qpp/qpp2/).
The tower in the center is a prefab by Steve Lieb.
The bridge in the front is a prefab by Joe the Slayer.
I also ended up with a huge amount of textures and skies.  I am sure that some of them are custom made,
so my heart goes out to those graphics guys, I'd give credits for the ones i used, but I dont know who
might have even done them.

* Copyright / Permissions *
I have included the .map file, so that you can modify at will.  Cut, copy, paste, I dont care.
Just be sure that if you copy the prefabs that I talked about above, you give the creators credit.
You are free to distribute this level as long as you aren't charging *ANYTHING* for it.

* What next? *
Well if I can ever get the time away from school, I will finish Action Map 2.  It is basically an extended version of 1,
with 2 bases for team support when/if Action quake supports it.
