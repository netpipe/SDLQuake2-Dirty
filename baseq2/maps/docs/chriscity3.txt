Notes	: If you have a problem with the lighting on this level, mail me with suggestions!
	  This is my first map released on the net.
	  I have kept the r_speeds low despite the outdoor setting! It rarely goes above
	  800. Basically this means that the level is very playable on most machines.
	  Because of the 20 or so areaportals, the framerate on my p2-300 with voodoo2
	  stays around 45-60 fps, and my friend says it runs fine in software on his p150.

PORK! PORK DAMN YOU! POOOOORRRRRKKKKK!!

What the? How'd that get there....

* Level Information *

Description		: Welcome to the Forsaken City, a city where everyone once lived,
			  but went insane and killed each other with various firearms :)			  
			  This part of a city has some streets, buildings, and a
			  sewer. It has 2 parts - The bright side and the dark
			  side (cue evil music). The bright side has a 5 floor office
			  building, a slum-like apartment building, and an industrial
			  warehouse. Go through the tunnel and you will reach the dark
			  side, where things are darker (surprise!). There you will
			  find 2 motel rooms, a pool and a church dedicated to a certain
			  game :) Also, beneath the city is a long sewer tunnel.

Weapon Locations	: Loads of weapons + ammo on this level, enjoy!
			  Shotgun #1 - 2nd floor of the apartment on the bed
			  Shotgun #2 - In the sewers
			  MP5 Machinegun #1 - 2nd floor of the office on the table
			  MP5 #2 - The tower in the church
			  Handcannon - The 2nd motel room
			  Sniper Rifle - The roof of the office building
			  M4 Assault Rifle - In the rafters of the warehouse
			  Grenades are scattered around the level.

* Play Information *
New Sounds              : Not really
New Textures            : Yes (some modified from other aq2 levels)

* Construction *
Base                    : A lot of 0's and 1's
Editor(s) used          : Qoole, BSP, QuArK, Wally for textures
			  I went insane making this level. Reason: Haven't found a perfect
			  editor. Qoole is near perfect, but it has a 300 brush limit!
			  BSP is hard as hell to use!
			  QuArK is just plain weird!
Known Bugs              : I get a Com_sprintf overflow: 47 in 32 error when it starts
			  (this does nothing)
			  The water in the sewers appears to flow in weird directions
			  The duplicate weapons dont respawn too well (Action Quake bug)
			  The road lines appear a bit screwy in some places

DAMMIT! Our clan isn't Zoid, after that CTF guy!

Ooops... got carried away again.... sorry :)

an Ass Whooping (TM), 'cause Stone Cold said so!
Just PLEASE don't say the map looks like my face after a point blank handcannon blast :)
