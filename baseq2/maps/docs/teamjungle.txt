* Authors Note *

A cupple of hours ago, Bartender emailed me, and asked me if I could do 
a teamplay version of Jungle1. (My first map, worth a look). I decided to
give it a go, and after about 3 hours of work, it's finally finished.

I decided not to include any fancy stuff, as I wanted to keep the r_speeds low 
(too bad I didn't do too well =(

I was gonna include water in this map, but I it made the game too slow. I could
have done muddy water instead of transparent, but it didn't look good - at all.

You'll also notice that the grass textures are 3x bigger. This will help framerate
on non-3dcard mashines.

a = sniper rifle   d = m4
b = sawed off	   e = mp5\10
c = showgun

Like jungle1, this level has very limited ammo. I like it that way.

I am NOT happy about this map, as it actually breaks 1000 r_speeds at one place, 
but some of my buds liked it, so I decided to release it..

* Legal Crap *

You can do whatever you want with this level, AS LONG AS YOU GIMME CREDITS.
Fair enough, ain't it?
