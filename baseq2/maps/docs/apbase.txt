If you are a fan of the movie Austin Powers, I think you might like this level.
If you hate the movie.... I really pity you, but here goes:
Just delete AP*.WAV out of your \quake2\action\sound directory if you REALLY
hate it that much and pretend its a normal action quake level :)

* Level Information *

Description		: An installation in the desert.
			  The installation has 4 floors (but its not that big)
			  and there is an outdoor area.
			  I would think that this level might be better suited
			  for teamplay (see my notes below).

Chris' notes		: This base has a few things that you should know about:
			  - If someone is getting the M4 in the glass tube, push
			    the button on the wall and drown 'em in acid! Yes!
			  - The security room (2nd floor) will let you see which rooms
			    in the installation are occupied. Great for teamplay.
			  - The installation has a self-destruct mechanism that will
			    kill anyone inside after a 20 second countdown! w00p! The
			    detonator is protected by 2 laser checkpoints, find out
			    how to toggle them! Use this to flush everyone out of the
			    base. So, if you start to hear sirens, bolt for the nearest
			    exit! This feature resets every 8 minutes.
			  - In the meeting room (war room), push the button to give
			    the people in the seats a nice surprise!
			  - The jail doors can only be opened from outside the jail, as
			    you might expect. The doors start closed, so if you want to
			    control access thru the tunnel, hit the button.
			  
			  I know, I should have made a skin for the fembots.
			  But hey, I am not a very good artist. Skins/Textures are not
			  really my specialty (as you might have guessed from CHRISCITY3).
			  If someone could make a fembot skin (use the Iron Maiden model),
			  could you send it to me? (email above)
			  Just so you know, the skin would be at:
			  \quake2\action\models\monsters\bitch\skin.pcx
			  If you really think my textures suck, tell me how to make them
			  better! The plane textures look weird, but its the 60's baby!
			  

Weapon Locations	: Shotgun #1 - Austin's airplane
			  Shotgun #2 - Doctor Evil's pod, 3rd floor
			  MP5 Machinegun - Fembot room, 1st floor
			  Handcannon - Jail, basement
			  Sniper Rifle - Scott's room
			  M4 Assault Rifle - The glass tube, 2nd floor
			  Grenades - Lobby, 1st floor
				   - Supply room, 2nd floor
				   - Pod room, 3rd floor
				   - Outside, near the road

* Play Information *
New Sounds              : Yeah, baby, Yeah!
			  Got most of the sounds from www.moviesounds.com/austin
			  The music in Scott Evil's room is from Korn's new song
			  Got the Life. Korn rocks! If you don't like it, turn it off!
New Textures            : Yes (some modified from other aq2 levels)
			  I know the picture of Doctor Evil doesnt look too good,
			  that's because it doesnt fit the quake 2 palette very well.
			  The plane textures, the signs, and a wall, ceiling and floor
			  were done by me.

* Construction *
Editor(s) used          : Mostly Qoole, a little QuArK, Wally for textures
Known Bugs              : The shotgun doesnt respawn too well (Action Quake bug/limitation)
			  The lighting from the generator room is a bit messed
			  The plane textures are slightly misaligned (rrgh... damn Qoole!)

* Build Time *
Computer		  : P2-300, 64MB ram, Voodoo2 video
Brushes			  : about 950 or so
QBSP3			  : 22 seconds
QVIS3 -level 4		  : 1 hour, 18 minutes
ARGHRAD -bounce 8 -extra  : 11 minutes
