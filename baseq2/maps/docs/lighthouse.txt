* Changes since version 1.0 *

- Minor geometry errors corrected (compile was 4 times shorter)
- Water is now opaque
- Doors inside the house now stay open
- Most doors stay open longer (5 seconds)
- Texture directory renamed to godinc to conform to AQMD standards
- Disclaimer information on the Ren and Stimpy stuff
- Much better r_speeds and frame rates... I challenge you to find the
  one place where r_speeds exceed 1000!

TURN GL_MODULATE DOWN DAMMIT! IT LOOKS JUST FINE WITH GL_MODULATE 1!
That rant is for you blind 3d card users who need to eat more carrots :)

Get this map at www.quakeclan.net/20id/cool.html if the depot is down.
Yeah, that's my clan page :)

This is my 3rd Action Quake map. My other maps are CHRISCITY3 and APBASE.
Personally, I think this map is better than those 2 combined.
And I think this level is ORIGINAL and it's not a sequel. God Incarnate
don't do sequels. It's not a freaking city map either. It did start out
as one but it slowly evolved into something totally different.

* Level Information *

Description:
"Under the Lighthouse" can best be described as a vacation home area at
night. The level is not very big, and in teamplay the rounds will progress
quickly as people can't avoid each other for long, and campers are easy to
find. This doesn't mean that there is no cover though :)
The level has 2 areas - a coastal bay area with a lighthouse and a boat,
and an estate area with a nice house, garden and a little hut. Oh yeah,
it's at night, but not too dark cause you gots the moon and stars.

BONUS: Can you guess what band does the song "Under the Lighthouse"?
My brother likes them a lot.

New Sounds: Yeah, just 2.
A cricket sound and everyone's favorite theme song :)
		
New Textures: Yes.
About 1/3 of the textures were made by me, another 1/3 are from
Ruskprick's maps (he is a texturing GOD, thanks man!), and the other 1/3
are probably taken/modified from other textures. Thanks to all the
respective people who I took them from.
As for the Stimpy texture being copyrighted material, I believe it isn't
because I got the picture from a Ren and Stimpy fan page. Besides, Ren and
Stimpy isn't even on TV anymore. However, if the AQMD feels that it isn't
allowed, I can make a replacement texture quick.

Level Editing: Qoole 2.50, Quark to correct everything Qoole screwed up :)

Texture Editing: Wally 1.2, Paint Shop Pro 5

Known Bugs:
Minor texture alignment problems. Try to find them!

Personal Gripes:
1 out of 10 times you'll take leg damage when you jump off the ramp and
land on the pillar.
One time, I had the spinning turd in the toilet crushing me! It's VERY rare.

Really Cool Thing To Do:
See that huge ramp/hill? Run off that, jump, turn, shoot your friend in the
head, land on the pillar, and say "Who's your daddy?"
Oh yeah, don't dive into the underwater rock from the lighthouse. It hurts.

I am not responsible for anything stupid that you do.
This level will NOT Fuck your computer up the Goat Ass (TM) or mess up
Quake 2 or Action Quake if you install it right.

Don't decompile/hack/prod my map with pointy objects.
Ask me if you want a .QLE file or .MAP file.

Go ahead, use the textures and sounds from this map. GO NUTS.
