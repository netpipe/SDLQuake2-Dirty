Description             : Map for TEAMPLAY Action Quake (http://action.telefragged.com).
                          This, to my knoweldge is, is the first AQ2 map with an objective other
			  than killing all the other team. You can also bag the loot by 
			  escaping in the getaway truck.  Before you can do this you must
			  deactivate the security.  At least 8 players i rekon.  If you are
			  interested in how it was done, the engine for the triggers is in the 
			  maintenance room next to the 'truck' room.  Highest r_speed < 900. 

Installation            : * Unzip theist.ZIP into Quake2/Action directory.

Known Bugs                : On the odd occasion you may here the truck start or an exposion
			    going off about 12 seconds into the round.  This is because
			    a trigger (e.g. the truck) was activated just before the round end
			    the sounds you hear are a consequence of putting that right.
			    Be careful on the truck, you sometimes get flattened.  I've tried 
			    my best to minimize this problem but I think it is a lag issue.
