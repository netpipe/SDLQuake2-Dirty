Description             : It is a Spanish looking town in the hills
			  on the coast with a port. In the highest hills along
			  the coast, there is a villa, follow the tunnel and then
                          the marketplace, then in the dark, a church, follow the 
                          road down the mountains to the waterfront, where you'll
			  see a pirate ship. Have fun, and don't fall into the water,
			  or get sucked out to sea.

                          * IMPORTANT * IT HAS COME TO MY ATTENTION THAT A SMALL
                          PORTIOJN OF THE MAP WAS SOMEONE ELSE'S. THE REASON FOR THIS
                          MIXUP BEING, AN ASSHOLE I KNOW LOVES NINJAS, HE SAID HE WANTED A
                          NINJA DARK MAP. SO I SAID GO AHEAD LAZY ASS MAKE ONE. HE SAID HE
                          DID AND SENT ME THE SHIP AREA IN THE .qle FORMAT. HE TOLD ME TO 
                          POGOTA ON TO OF THE SMALL BUILDING. HE SAID HE GOT THE IDEA FROM A
                          VIDEO GAME HE HAD CALLED TECHU. BUT THE GOOD MAN OSWALD HAS INFORMED
                          ME THAT HE WAS A LYING CHEATING BASTARD THAT MUST DIE. HE STOLE THAT MAP
                          FROM ORANGE SMOOTHY PRODUCTIONS. VENGANCE WILL BE MINE. I'LL MAME THAT 
                          BASTARD FOR CHEATING ME AND GETTING ME IN DEEP. SORRY FOR ANYONE
                          WHO ORIGINALLY CAME UP WITH THE CONCEPT OF THIS AREA. I SHOULDN'T OF
                          HAPPENED LIKE THIS, HIS ICQ NICK IS EITHER AMLIETH OR *(TORONAG)*
                          TAKE PLEASURE IN BUGGING HIM ALL YOU WANT. AGAIN SORRY THIS HAD
                          TO HAPPEN.
