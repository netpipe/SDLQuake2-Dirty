                          my variation of his map,

                          testing my map.

================================================================

Philosophy of gameplay  : My goal in making this map was to create something for
                          those players who prefer the stealthy stalking movements
                          and skills of a military sniper, although it's certainly
                          a good map for just running around in.  I wanted something
                          out in the open and that provided longer distances for
                          shooting than an enclosed map could provide.  To aid in
                          sneaking around carefully, I replaced the elevators with
                          stairs.

* Construction *

Base                    : Created from scratch as my first ever map, but
                          heavily influenced by City Arena (see Credits, above).

Known Bugs              : Two sniper rifles are available, but one may disappear
                          if there are only two players and the second rifle is
                          left lying around too long.  At extreme distances, there
                          may be some "graying out" of the distant walls if you're
                          not using a graphics card -- think of it as mirage.

===================================================================================

* Miscellaneous information *

There's a "regular Quake2" version (w/appropriate weapons) available
called rqnitro.bsp

I called it "Nitro City" just to give it a unique name, figuring that
eventually there are going to be dozens of city-based Action maps.  The
"Nitro" comes from my fondness of British Nitro Express cartridges.

Spoiler information (somewhat): I haven't tried to make anything deliberately
secret, though a few things won't be obvious unless you've got time to explore
without getting shot.  Rock climbers will want to look for a way to get up the
wall and snipers will want to look for a way to get up to the roof of the
highest building.
