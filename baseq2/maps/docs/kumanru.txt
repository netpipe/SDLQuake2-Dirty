* Level info *

There's rumor of great treasures to be found in the newly discovered Temple of Kumanru. 
However, there are more greedy hands than can comfortably share any fortunes that may be
found, so the order of the day is to take care of the competition first, and THEN go looking
for riches.

There are two sniper towers... one easily attacked and the other very difficult to approach 
(watch those swinging bells... if you're not careful they'll knock you off and you could 
break a leg with the fall). There's a slaughtering chamber, a meditation chamber, a couple 
sunny alcoves, a sewer, and of course, the altar. Who knows what secrets are hidden within
the walls of this temple?
