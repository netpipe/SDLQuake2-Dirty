  Problems with maps when downloaded from AQMD:
  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  actcity - this also applies to actcity2 since they share the textures
          - textures/CRCITY\SKY1.wal missing
          - textures/CRCITY\CZELSIGN.wal missing
          - bad path, doesn't work with actcity on *nix systems
          - must be UPPERCASE to work on *nix systems, fixes actcity2
          - actcity may be a lost cause for *nix systems, works in Windows

  actdam - sound/barbq/breath.wav is missing
         - I copied a "silent" WAV to this name (thanks AQMD Forum/GreyDeath!)

  beer - textures/sinner/ceiling3.wal is missing
       - I copied the texture from the one included in nobeer

  beware - textures/wolf/origin.wal missing
         - found copy in textures/nemesis, copied it over

  cinema3 - env/black**.tga are missing
          - they were saved as BMP, I converted them to TGA

  coverme - env/city1**.tga and env/city1**.pcx are missing
          - see matrix2 below for more information

  dam - sound/wind2x.wav is missing
      - it was in sound/dam/, copied it to correct location

  foresthighway - textures/g4meah0lic/xddoor3.wal is missing
                - there's a "xdoor3.wal" in there so I renamed it

  highrise - sound/highrise/fan.wav is missing
           - sound/highrise/wind.wav is missing
           - sound/highrise/catapult.wav is missing
           - sound/highrise/door.wav is missing
           - sound/highrise/barn.wav is missing
           - were placed in "sounds", not "sound" so I moved them

  matrix2 - env/CITY1**.tga and env/CITY1**.pcx are missing on *nix systems
          - coverme uses the same env files
          - changed "city" to "CITY" to fix

  mesto - sound/garff/heli.wav is missing
        - I had this file in another AQ2 installation(?), copied it over

  p1_lightbeam - sound/ppp/seagulls.wav missing
               - in wrong directory, copied into proper directory

  paradise - textures/paradise\movie2.wal not found on *nix systems
           - textures/paradise\movie3.wal not found on *nix systems
           - textures/paradise\movie4.wal not found on *nix systems
           - may be a lost cause on *nix systems, works in Windows
           - PACMAN, map author, indicates that this cannot be fixed for this map

  storehouse - sound/jamesc/ambi5.wav missing
             - was placed in "sounds", not "sound" so I moved it

  subtransit2 - textures/mia/xderty.wal missing
              - textures/mia/yellow.wal missing
              - provided to me by the map author, the AQMD ZIP is the "wrong one"

  teamjungle - textures/shadow1/kasse1sw_1.wal missing, copied a new one
             - I had this file in another AQ2 installation(?), looks fine

  urban - urban.bsp missing
        - included in ZIP but not in action/maps/ so I moved it there
        - sound/world/mb8.wav missing, renamed included "amb8.wav"

  village - textures/bad/entity.wal missing
          - I copied a different WAL over, map looks ok (thanks AQMD Forum!)

  winter - deleted unused textures as indicated by PACMAN, map author
         - textures/winter/dark.wal has been deleted
         - textures/winter/firewall.wal has been deleted
         - textures/winter/woodfloor.wal has been deleted


  All of the problems have been corrected in this uber map pack.
  These problems may still exist in the original files from AQMD.
