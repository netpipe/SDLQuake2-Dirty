Thank must go to my little sister, Mimosa Schmidt (the names German, dont worry :-)) for helping me to record some of those nifty sounds you hear in game
I must also thank the great people at the map depot for helping out with some of my problems, and you know who you are.
I also must thank Sveten {PaGaN}, Deity {PaGaN}, and KiLlIsTiNg {PaGaN} for helping to test this map
And of course if I forgot about ID software and the A team , oh and the mapdepot in general, I have not now ;-)
Thank all of you ;-)

Despriction.
===========

Pretty simple really, an Airliner cruising somewhere above the ground :-)
So if the plane hits some turbelence, then you will no why :-)
Theres a cockpit, 2 galleries, 2 cabins, 4 bathrooms, and a cargo hold downstairs to have some fun in.

Bugs
====

In a few spots the r_speeds get up to 800, but you have to stand in special little spots to do so.
but over all the average at 500, 600 or so. The turbelence also does not work to well when you get high pings over 400, 500 or so on a slower server.
And watch out for the rotating doors door stairs as they can wedge you onto the conveyor belt.

Legal stuff
===========

I dont mind if you decide you want to use this map as a base (not that I recommend it) or what to use the sounds, or any of my textures, please, (as I did make them all myself) ask me (schmidta@netspace.net.au) before using them.
If you ask nicely I will surely give them to you, free, yes free of charge.
and if you have any problems, even suggestions, email me.

Thank you for Downloading Airliner, and I hope you enjoyed playing as much as i enjoyed making it.
