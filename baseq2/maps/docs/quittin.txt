Background Story        : You've had it!  You've been pushed around and abused by 
                          your co-workers, your boss, and even the customers for 
                          too long!  They have unfairly denied you promotions, 
                          raises, and vacation time!  They've stolen your work and 
                          taken credit for it as their own!  Now you've decided that 
                          enough is enough, and it's your turn to kick some @$$!  
                          You are gonna show them all!
