Notes:

2nd map ever (office2 first)...

This map is huge, and is meant to also support large teams in teamplay...

This is THE sniping map, i made it fairly easy to prosper as a sniper...

Uhhh, it's huge, so 1on1 is still fun, but the gameplay becomes more intense and 'sneaky'.. use walking (so there's no footsteps) often...

Prison76 (vs. prison66) makes it compatible with software, and significantly improves framerates everywhere.
