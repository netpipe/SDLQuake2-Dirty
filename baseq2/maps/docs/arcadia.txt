				 Story

6-22-1963
-Arcadia, a young growing city in northern Russia vanishes.  The Russian Military is baffled 
by the disappearance of Arcadia, the cause is unknown to them, however a top secret 
underground military research facility located in the vicinity persuades the Russian 
Military to conceal any knowledge of Arcadia's disappearance from ever being released to the 
rest of the world, including many Russian Divisions.

5-17-1964
The military officer in charge of the cover up dies, with him the knowledge of Arcadia's 
disappearance is lost forever, and the city it self becomes nothing but and urban myth...

7-30-1984
-During the Cold War a covert operation of the United States government has begun.
A small team of Elite military operatives has penetrated Russia's borders from the north 
after an Arial drop off from a stealth plane flying over the polar ice caps.  Upon landing
the U.S. Special Forces team heads south en route to a nuclear missile silo.  There mission 
to retrieve a active Russian nuclear warhead without being detected.  With the purpose of 
allowing United States scientist to analyze the Russia's nuclear capabilities.
-A small, remote radar station in Siberia detects a small radar signature from the 
parachutes of the U.S. Special Forces team.  Unaware if it was a true radar signature 
or just a glitch the Russia radar station follows procedure and reports it to Russian 
military immediately.  Russian military locates the position of the radar signature and 
uses satellite imagery.  The image produces a small number of dots.  Unsure of the 
exact nature of the dots the Russian's believe them to be people and in fear of those 
people being part of a U.S. military operation the Russian military dispatches its 
own small team of marine special forces.  The marine force is given the mission 
objectives of finding and accessing the threat of the unknown 'dots' found on the 
satellite image and neutralizing any threat.

8-1-1984
-The Russian marine team arrives at the position of the radar signature to find several
hidden parachutes.  Quickly they pick up the tracks of the U.S. Special forces team and 
begin their pursuit.

8-5-1984
-The U.S. Special force team comes upon a small urban city.  Surprised, they re-check their 
maps.  They find only terrain on their maps where the city stands, the closes city on the 
map is 94 miles away.  Confused they approach the city with caution and paranoia.  Upon
entering the find it empty.  An eerie silence pierced the town.  The U.S. Special forces
team was baffled by the fact that it was empty, yet the buildings showed no sign of decay.
-Close on the U.S. Special Forces tracks the Russian marine team came upon the same city.
The Russian marine team was just as confused to find the city there as well.  After checking
their maps they found no city there as well.  With the same confusion as the U.S. Special 
forces team they approached with caution.

-Now both rival factions wondered the streets of "The Lost City of Arcadia"...
