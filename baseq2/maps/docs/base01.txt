Details:
When I started to work on this map I intended to make it for standard Q2, but then I didn't finish it because I started working on the AirQuake2 TC which took all my time. Some time ago I saw ActionQuake and thought of finishing it quickly as an Action-Map...

IMPORTANT:
The textures are for use in AIRQUAKE 2 ONLY !!! Alun gave them to me as an exception only!
Do not use them without his permission! (uberian@vortexq.com)
