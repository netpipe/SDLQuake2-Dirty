  uberSERVER: uberPAK for servers
  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  All the Official Action Quake 2 maps as of 7/30/2000.  These were 
  all gathered from the Action Quake Map Depot.  There are 181 maps 
  total.  You can check for more at:  http://aqmd.action-web.net/

  This package is specifically designed for AQ2 server installations.
  If you plan to use these maps as a client, i.e. just a player, then
  please get uberPAK as it is far better suited to that purpose and 
  saves about 25 MB of space over this server package.


  This map listing is split into 2 sections.  

  Section 1: Map list

  The first section has only the map names, you can cut and 
  paste from this list to make a server map rotation, for example.
  Or perhaps just print out the list and have it as a reference 
  for what the actual map names are.  

  Section 2: Map information

  The second section has the map filename, title, author, size,  
  release date, and number of players the map was designed for.  
  All this information is from the Action Quake Map Depot.  
  Please go there for more information, reviews, tutorials, and 
  lots of kickass map-related information!  http://aqmd.action-web.net/
