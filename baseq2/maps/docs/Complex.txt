A computer facility complex. Watch for lasers!


"PORTALS" is located at "www.planetquake.com/portals"

	The Complex is not like many action maps, its
more of a standard Q2 fort map really in terms of the
architecture. But it plays well and thats really all
that counts :)

	I've heard storys of maps that have had no light
or full light and vis errors. but they have been a blast
to play and get popular by word of mouth. So in the end
its not how pretty the map is... its how it plays that 
really counts!
