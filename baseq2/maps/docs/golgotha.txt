* Level info *

Pretty self- explanatory; I just tried to make a simple map with good ambience, low r-speeds, and balanced gameplay.  I named it "Golgotha City" because most of the textures in the map were originally created by a computer game company called Golgotha (whose internet address is at the very end of this readme).
