Textures		: All textures are made by me, no standard
			  textures are used, so there shouldn't be
			  a problem with copyrights (they're all mine).
Known Bugs              : The helicopter has some game related
			  problems, which can be easy avoided:
			  1. Don't sit on the pilot chair.
			  2. Don't crouch while in the helicopter
			  3. Don't jump when you're standing on the
			     runners outside the helicopter (is runners
			     the right word?)

Note on new textures
If someone want's to use my self-made textures, he must contact
me to get my permission! Normally I will give you this permission,
as long as you're not using them for a commercial project (then
we have to see how we do it).
