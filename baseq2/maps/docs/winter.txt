* Construction *

Editor(s) used          : Here we go:
                          WorldCraft 1.6 for building
                          Qoole 2.5 & 99 for some editing and failed compiles
                          Q2 BeaVeR (really.. thats the name) for the final compile
Known Bugs              : Umm... you can get "hung up" in one spot,
                          but anyone who goes there diserves to be
                          a target for a few seconds :)
			  The lighting in the cave is a bit off, but when
                           you only have 32mb of ram for test compiles, its
                           good enough :)
Build Time              : 4 months on and off
Compile Time		: Qbsp3: 26 seconds
                          Qvis3: 7 hours (approx.)
                          Qrad3: 4 hours (approx.)
                           (Arghrad... cool phong shading in the caves)
