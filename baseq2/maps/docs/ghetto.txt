BSP/VIS/RAD time -- 6.5 hours

Death Match level for Action Quake 2.

Set in daylight, but with shadows for the snipers and campers.  The idea was to encourage room-to-room stalking, rather than the frenzy of gunfire that's evolving in Action Quake (the best Q2 Mod yet).

This is my first level for Quake II.  I tested it with BOTS and it seemed to work okay -- they killed me.
