Settings		: Gas mark 7 for 30 minutes, broil then stir with an M4, add a sprin-killing of grenades
			  and drink ravenously
Deathmatch 2-4          : My kinda style. Not like Jungle where the first killer controls the map (in 1v1s or 3ppl 			  ffa) Try sneaking around a bit.
Deathmatch 5-100	: Well 100 is pushing the limit but yep. The map won't handle it but the server will :)Teamplay		: Well I have to suggest **600 VS 600** or somewhere near that, its a big map after all.
			  Try 7 vs 7
New Sound		: No <see below>
New Graphics		: Yes. Buttons for the elevator and shower floors....which you cant see....erm
New music		: No, unless you count the sweet sound of birds singing then getting fooked out of the air 			  by my MP5

* Other Info *

This is my third Action Quake map that has been finished. My first crashed servers and some clients (All foreign) so that never got anywhere even though it was the bestter of the first two. The second was a small street area about the size of actcity2 without teh 3rd court :). That one was submitted at the same time Spectacle announced that city maps were the spawn of the devil. I, no doubt, contributed to his removal and that was because I made this map. Now thats fun :)
	Oh, you may notice 2 banners, one giant, one small. The small one is an advert for my close m8's
Bruce Willis site (I don't THINK he's gay) The otehr banner is my clan. We have no website, we're only
2 weeks old.
