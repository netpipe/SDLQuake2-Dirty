			  Version 1.5, lighting was redone with Phong shading courtesy of 
			  Arghrad 2.0, added flag spawn points for CTB, added grenades
			  for DM and most importantly achieved a major fps boost around
			  the landing craft after reworking the textures (has anyone
			  else noticed how MUCH difference texture resolution can have
			  on frame rates? As far as we can tell it isn't documented

Details			:
The map is a bond finale style assault on a secret base located by the resident super-spy.
The LCH (Landing Craft Heavy) has arrived with chopper ready for the assault. 
(If you haven't guessed its the RAN to the rescue!) 
The fortifications, the bunkers, the machinegun emplacements (which can be fired btw), etc. 
are all to protect one thing ... 
the entrance to the super-villain's complex.

Beware of the Vulcan Phalanx, the machinegun pits, the exploding barrels and the man-eating sharks. 

P.S. mined where you tread ! ;>

Look out for Beach Assault II: Beyond the Secret Door! coming to a theatre near you soon ...
