Description             : This level was designed for ActionQuake. This is my first released map,                         so take it easy on me. I'm learning as i go. After nearly completing the                         layout, I started tinkering with making textures, you'll find a few new                          ones in here.Hope you like them. Anyone wanting to use my textures in                            their maps, feel free to do so. You'll find them in the cougardt                                 directory. Most of the textures on this map are from other                                       maps,quake2,and qoole 2.5.

Credits                 :KC D.O.A. for helping me with the sound.
