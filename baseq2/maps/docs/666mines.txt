Map Name:		Route 666 : The Lava Mine
File Name:		666mines.bsp
Author:			Ben Lyons
E-Mail:			benlyons@eisa.net.au
Description:		Umm... A small underground mine, somewhere in the Desert. 

===================================================================================================

Construction

Base: 			Scratch
Editor:			QERadiant Build 147, Wally, Ulead MediaStudio Pro 2.5b Audio editor, Qped
			and Adobe Photoshop 5
Build time:		Hard to tell really
Copmile time:		QBSP3 - 'bout 20 secs
			QVIS3 - 8018 secs (2.2 hours)
			ARGHRAD - 12207 secs (3.4 hours)
Compile Machine:	P2 450 with 128 mb RAM
Known Bugs:		-When a body dies in the lava, it creates a constant hissing sound. This is 
			cause normally in Q2 it would gib and go away, but because of AQ2 it wont.
			This isn't my fault, and it should only be a minor problem in CTB or small 
			games of DM.
			-The fans cause problems with knives. It is possible to jam a fan by chucking
			a knife into it (which is fine), but it is also possible to jam them by throwing
			knives near them. Sometimes when you throw the knives near the fan, instead of 
			the knife sticking there, it will get flicked a small distance across, often
			resulting in the knife sticking in the air. Once again this is the fault of the
			Q2 engine, not me, as func_rotating's seem to interfere with the nearby null space,
			particularly in the area perpendicular to their rotational axis. Normally this 
			problem isnt noticable, but knives cross into null space when they stick into walls,
			and thus get affected by the bug. Don't worry, it is barely noticable unless you
			go out of your way trying to set it off.
			-Theres a bit of the long distance GL clipping bug. It's very minor though, and what
			map doesnt have it?
			-The sun in the sky doesnt match the angle of the shadows... oh well

Installation

You should know this by now..... Unzip it all to your action directory with include subfolders checked.
If this doesnt work then blame it on AQMD.

Credits

Accurate texture crediting is a difficult thing to do. When picking textures, I tend to take textures from
other maps, who's authors had taken them from other maps, who's authors had taken them from other maps... etc.
So short of e-mailing every-one who ever made a map to ask where they got their texutures from, there is no
way for me to give complete accreditation to every-ones work that I used. However, here I will try my best.
Thanks to the following for textures in no particular order:

Ruskprick
JesperMyrfors
the gimp
The makers of the Xatrix texture pack
Gerbil!
Jed
Me ;)

And every-one else who I wasn't able to work out, you know who you are, give yourself a pat on the back.

The car is the q2car prefab by Olli Paakkonen, which I modified a bit to make it look/work better.

Special credit to "Jed D'Lagged : Inbred Redneck Samurai Assassin extrodinare" for lots of things including 
the sign textures, playtesting, and ideas.

Authors notes:

1. Normally I only make a map when I feel like it. But $350 of prize money is too good to pass up, so I kinda
had to force things. Considering that I only found out about the competition about 20 days in, I was a bit 
rushed. This probably isn't the best map I have made, but it was the best I could do on short notice, so it will 
have to do.

2. With a bit of grenade jumping, it is possible (but difficult) to reach areas of the level where your opponent
would have no chance of ever being able to see you. On a server with no rcons, p_kick or similar command, or
roundlimit, this could possibly allow some lamer to create a never ending round. If you are thinking of being
that lamer, dont... I know where you live

3. No, I don't like the top bit much either. Kind of a let-down to the rest of the level. There is sooooooo much I
could do with it, but r_speeds are creeping  above 1000 as it is, so unfortunatly I will have to leave it :( 

4. I know there have been maps made of mines before, but before you write this off as 'done before', take a look
at those maps. You will notice that they are nothing like this map whatsoever.

5. Ladder/lift camping *might* become a problem if you are playing with teamloads of lamers. While a team of 4
patient campers probably could set up a very big and effective tent on the surface, the same could be said
of most maps. If you catch people constantly camping the ladders or lifts, feel free to call them @#*%&#
*%*$#&%* camping &#*%&#* lamer #%&*#&$*##& skilless @!*&^$%# $&*#@& campers for me.

6. This map is of mines, it had to be dark at least in some places. Of course this creates the age old problem 
of gl_modulate/irvision and their assorted 'issues'. I have my gl_modulate set to 1 on a V2 based card, with my
brightness adjusted to about the level that I think most people play with. I fine-tuned the lighting so it 
fitted my brightness/modulate settings. Because it walks a fine line between too dark and too bright, you might
need to fine-tune your brightness settings. Keep in mind that you are not supposed to be able to see people hiding
in the dark corners. My hope is that this will allow items such as stealth slippers and silencers to actualy be 
useful enough for people to take them.

6 seems an appropriate number to finish on :)

Other Stuff

This map was made by Ben Lyons. Feel free to distribute as you like, so long as there is no fee attached, 
and this .txt is included, unmodified, in its entirity. Feel free to use the textures as you like, but be 
careful when copying them into the same directory as textures from other maps, as many have the same name
but may have been slightly changed for various reasons.


If you have any comments, suggestions, flames, ideas, money, requests for the .map file, send them to me at
