	'PUT THE MONEY IN THE F**KIN' BAG'.... Yes you too can now play
a major part in a bungled bank robbery, your back stabbing partners have 
turned on you and turned on each other. It wasn't your fault it went 
wrong.. I mean, who knew the cashier had a shawn off at her side eh?
Shoot outs a plenty as the cops come to 'KEEP THE PIECE' but then you 
gave give the fuzz a piece of something quite unpleasant.

But hey, you gotta a clip and I think I can grab that shawn off without
being seen...

HERE ARE SOME THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW, WELL MAYBE....
 
1.This is a rather shoddy exscuse for a map, I downloaded a demo of a 
map editor and went to work making a map of a bank.

2.I used lots o' prefabs in this - security cameras, the stairs and 
the wheel that operates the safe. Well done the prefab makers - sorry 
I can't remember your names. 

3. Please note the safe round back of the cashier counters, it is 
designed to be a fiendish thing. You will be lured by the goodies 
inside and then a devious fool can sneak up behind and close the
door on you! I made the safe door slower to close than the door 
for, if it was faster, people would dub it 'unrealistic'.

4. The early warning system is quite complicated... The security
cameras don't just move, they're hooked up to a pannel in one of the
offices, it'll look like 5 golden bars strapped to a wall and they 
can be just as valuble. There are 4 cameras, each has a corresponding
gold bar, when the camera spots someone the goldbar will rotate to the
right.

Camera 1 is located in the cashier area - it's the 1st gold bar
Camera 2 is located in the cashier area - it's the 2nd gold bar
Camera 3 is 'out of order'
Camera 4 is located in the safe         - it's the 4th gold bar
Camera 5 is located in the back watching- it's the 5th gold bar
the safe wheel.

If you have heeded the above advice you should be able to find
out if people are coming your way. BTW watch the hatch in the roof
...it's convieniently placed JUST BEHIND YOU.
Even precognition has it's draw backs.....

5. In the safe there are Gold bars [not worth much ] behind the cash desk
is some wads of cash - about as much use to you as a spoon in a gun
shop.

6.This is my map goddamit! but I was restricted to brushes [freeware]
but if you want to add to this map gimme a mail at 
citrus.frog@becs-ltd.demon.co.uk and I can make your life easier by
sending you the bank.map file.

This map could be so much more, you have the power to make it happen!!!
