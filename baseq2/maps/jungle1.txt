Description : An outdoor map, very nice for sniping. Trees and bushes, hills, everything.
              Uses the sun source for lights. It's too bright, but I don't wanna go tru 
	      another 40+ hours of VIS'ing again. Sorry - maybe in the future, tho.

Yeah, yeah, I know it's way too bright. Yeah, yeah, I know it's not a HPW's dream.
yeah, yeah, I know I should have added the river. Yeah, yeah, yeah. get over it.

Please, DO PLAY THIS LEVEL ON A LAN! It's AWESOME! (Well, I think so atleast)

Sure, it's kinda small, but I wanted to keep r_speeds at a minimum. Hit the hills, 
and get ready for some serious sniping!
