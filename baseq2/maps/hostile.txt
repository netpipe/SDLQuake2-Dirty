Notes:

Okay everybody, this is my first ever released map for Quake, Quake2 or any sort of mod
for any of those games. The last maps I released were for Doom][ and Heretic _way_ back
when.

The r_speeds are pretty decent, which is good because I was having some problems early on.
There's actually one corner where the r_speeds spike to 1200, but it only happens if you're
pretty much standing _exactly_ in that corner. Otherwise, they're mostly below 500, and
just about always under about 800.

Qoole made me rip my hair out a few times on several parts of the level. I can't explain
the horror of its super poor floating-point to integer conversions. Other than that and a
few "light leaks" this map was a dream to make.

* If you like this map, thank Cliffe. If it wasn't for his logical approach to a certain 
problem, this map wouldn't have been released at all.

textures.

Have fun playing the map!
