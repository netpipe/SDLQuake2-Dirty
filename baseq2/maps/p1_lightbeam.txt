Installation 		/
_______________________/

Unzip the contents of this zip into your Quake2/action directory *with folder 
names intact* (-d on pkunzip methinks).
If something goes wrong:
	-the .bsp file should be in action/maps,
	-the .pcx and .tga files should be in action/env
	-the .wal files should be in action/textures/ppp
	-doesn't matter where the .txt file ends up :)
To run the map, boot up Quake2 and type the following at the console:
	game action
	deathmatch 1
	map p1_lightbeam
Or just connect to a server with it Lightbeam on it's rotation.

Any problems, drop me a line (see 'contact' below).

Map title	: Lightbeam
Filename	: p1_lightbeam.bsp
Author		: P
About P		: 17 year old UK bloke type dude who's often refered to as either
		  'odd' or 'bloody weird' ;)
Editor 		: BSP (thanks for finishing it Yahn... or not)
Other P maps	: P0: Outpost 304 *sniff* a never released DM map *whimper* 

Build Time	: Hmm, did I have this beard when I started?! (off and on, spread 
		  over 2-3 months... god I wish I spent more time mapping...)
Compile Time	: Over-night (~ 7hrs) (wibble factor 10)

Q1		: Wassat then?
Q2 DM		: It'll work, but play like a pile of icky brown stuff (avoid).
Q2 SP		: For diving practice only
Q2 CO-OP	: Diving Gala anyone?
AQ2 DM		: Whoohoo  
AQ2 TP		: Kick Ass 

New sounds	: Yeah, a seagull one (credit to the seagulls).
New textures	: Yuppers lots, none by me tho (see credits plz).
New sky		: Yupski, see credits.
New brain	: Can't help you there, get back to your Sega Saturn dude ;)

Description	: A map for AQ2, with a lighthouse (or suitabley large tribute 
		  to female independance, take it as you wish), some offices, 
		  a carpark, some water, a few rocks, a few roofs, a warehouse...
		  oh and a caravan. Basically a good, compact, habour-ish style romp
		  with enough variation in it to keep most people happy.

		  Half way thru' making my second DM map, it suddenly struck on me 
		  that I needed more practice before going on with the map. Around
		  about the same time, I *really* got into AQ2... the rest is 
		  history/pain.

Special thanks to:
	-Rust   (gamedesign.net). A great help, cheers.
	-BSP HQ (bsphq.com). Cheers Deadmeat, your a star.
	-ID (www.idsoftware.com). Cheers for making me coffee and stuff... erm.

Thanks to:
	-Karsten, my brother. For being bloody supportive and encouraging, despite 
	 not *really* having a clue what I was doing, and why I was doing it :o)
	-'The Lardy One' for superb suggestions/ideas after beta testing. 
	-'Jagz' for more suggestions, and putting up with me while we tested it.
	-'Grom' for putting up with my WMG idea, and topical conversations etc ;)
	-'Rage' for suggestions after beta testing.
	-'Pig Pills' for having absolutely nothing to do with this map, but for
	  being incredibley patient with me and the CD thingy...
	
	-Everyone else who helped beta test it, ta very much.
	-Anyone who: plays this map and/or puts it on a server and/or reviews it etc. 
	 Cheers... you give me reason to churn this crap out :)
	-Clan <HooD> for being so kick ass!

Credit to:
	-David Hyde, textures.
	-CryptR, textures (and inspiration... Action City series kicks ass)
	-Whir, textures.
	-The dude who did the sky... Stecki mbe? I couldn't find a readme for it, sorry.

I think that's it for texture credits, but if not then please (please!) notify me. Nothing
worse than uncredited material :(
All textures where used from maps that'd allowed me to use it's textures (i.e. the author
permitted it in the readme). 
Can't thank the texture dudes enough, it's your work that got this map as far away from 
Strogg as is 'humanly' possible :)

Notes                   /
_______________________/

	-R_Speeds. I was mainly building this map for practice, and a bit of fun. Hence I
	 wasn't too strict on myself wrt r_speeds. Unfortunately as a result they can get 
	 rather high in some places, with areas of 850 or even more. I have a feeling this 
	 is going to be the main bitch about Lightbeam. Sorry :(
	-Both Teamplay and DM will work well on this map, but I'd reccomend keeping the 
	 numbers low... 5 a side TP should be ample. (not sure about max DM..?).
	-A short while before this map is/was released (but a long time after it was started)
	 another AQ2 ligthouse map was released. I didn't nab his idea, we're obviously just 
	 both on the same wavelength or summit. Fortunately both our maps are suitabley 
	 different, and so it's still worth me releasing this. Kudos to him, for making
	 a kick ass map :) (www.quakeclan.net/20id/cool.html) (by God Incarnate).
	-I almost certainly won't make a sequel to this map, but hope to make another AQ2 
	 map at some point, stay tuned for more of the P series :)
	-E-Mail me if you want the .map file.
	-DON'T play this map in normal Quake2 DM... it wasn't designed for it... trust me.
