Description             : This warehouse style map is made for the kick-ass mod Action Quake 2.
                          Best suited for 6-8 players. This is my first map(for Quake 2), and I
                          think it turned out ok. Oh, and please don't send me email telling me 
                          that there's no doors. I thought the theme of this map called for no 
                          doors. We all have our own opinions. Thank you. Extract this map to 
                          your /Action/Maps directory.
