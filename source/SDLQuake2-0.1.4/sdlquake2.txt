SDLQuake2 0.1

Based on R1Q2 b5510, R1GL 0.1.5.25 (http://www.r1ch.net/stuff/r1q2/)
and Quake2Forge 0.3.1CVS (www.quakeforge.net)

Basically this is a combination of R1Q2 and R1GL with
SDL code from Quake2Forge. Meaning it's R1Q2 protocol 35 compatible
Linux client. Tested on Debian Sarge. Both client and dedicated server.

I'm not sure what I'm going to do with the project but there will be
R1Q2 compatible future releases. This release is very close to vanilla
R1Q2 to make it easier to port future releases.

Requires libSDL, libjpeg and libpng.

Requires OpenGL, tested with NVidia.

Thanks to ID Software, R1CH and the QuakeForge team for their
outstanding work.
